# AgriAdapt üå±

## Overview
AgriAdapt is a **mobile and web platform** that helps African farmers adapt to climate change using **AI, IoT, and blockchain**. The platform provides real-time weather insights, AI-driven crop recommendations, IoT-based water optimization, and blockchain-based sustainability rewards.

---

## Features
‚úÖ **Weather Forecasting:** Get real-time weather insights.  
‚úÖ **Crop Recommendation:** AI-driven crop selection based on climate conditions.  
‚úÖ **Water Optimization:** IoT-based precision irrigation using soil moisture data.  
‚úÖ **Sustainability Rewards:** Blockchain-based incentives for sustainable farming practices.  
‚úÖ **Community Hub:** Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing (future feature).  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), PostgreSQL, AI (TensorFlow), IoT (MQTT)  
- **Frontend:** React (Web), React Native (Mobile)  
- **Cloud:** AWS (Hosting, Database, IoT Integration)  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum/Solana for sustainability rewards

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/soil-moisture" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"farmer_id": 1, "moisture_level": 25}'
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "suggestion": "Irrigate immediately"
}
```

### Blockchain Integration
**POST** `/reward-farmer`  
Reward a farmer with tokens for sustainable practices.
